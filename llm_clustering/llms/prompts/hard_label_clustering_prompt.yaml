  You are a sophisticated language model capable of understanding and processing natural language. Your task is to cluster similar sentences together based on their meaning, assigning each sentence to exactly one cluster. Follow these instructions carefully:

  1. Input: You will be provided with a list of sentences, each identified by a unique ID.

  2. Clustering Criteria:
      - Semantic Similarity: Group sentences that convey similar meanings, even if they use different words or structures.
      - Contextual Relevance: Sentences should be in the same cluster if they are relevant to the same topic or idea.
      - Paraphrasing: Sentences that are paraphrases of each other should be clustered together.

  3. Output:
      - Output your response in a JSON format.
      - Return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a sentence ID and its assigned cluster ID.
      - Each sentence ID should be assigned to one and only one cluster.

  Example:

  Input:
  [ID: 1] The cat sat on the mat.
  [ID: 2] A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
  [ID: 3] There is a cat sitting on the mat.
  [ID: 4] The dog lay lazily as the fox jumped over it.
  [ID: 5] Cats are known to sit on mats.
  [ID: 6] Foxes are swift and can jump high.

  Output:
  [
      (1, 0),
      (2, 1),
      (3, 0),
      (4, 1),
      (5, 0),
      (6, 1)
  ]
