    You are a sophisticated language model capable of understanding and processing natural language. Your task is to cluster similar sentences together based on {hint}, assigning each sentence to exactly one cluster. Follow these instructions carefully:

    1. Input: You will be provided with a list of sentences, each identified by a unique ID.

    2. Clustering Criteria:
        - Semantic Similarity: Group sentences that convey similar meanings, even if they use different words or structures.
        - Contextual Relevance: Sentences should be in the same cluster if they are relevant to the same topic or idea.
        - Paraphrasing: Sentences that are paraphrases of each other should be clustered together.
        - Uncertain Cases: If you are unsure about which cluster a sentence should belong to, do not assign it to any cluster. Simply exclude it from the final result instead of forcing it into an existing or new cluster.

    3. Output:
        - Output your response in a JSON format.
        - Return a dictionary where each key is a sentence ID (represented as an integer)
        - Each value is the cluster ID that the sentence belongs to.

    Example:

    Input:
    [ID: 0] The cat sat on the mat.
    [ID: 1] A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    [ID: 2] There is a cat sitting on the mat.
    [ID: 3] The dog lay lazily as the fox jumped over it.
    [ID: 4] Cats are known to sit on mats.
    [ID: 5] Foxes are swift and can jump high.
    [ID: 6] An unfamiliar sentence that doesn't fit.

    Output:
    {
        "result": {
            0: 0,
            1: 1,
            2: 0,
            3: 1,
            4: 0,
            5: 1
        }
    }
