    <example>
    Sentences:
    [ID: 0] The cat sat on the mat.
    [ID: 1] A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    [ID: 2] There is a cat sitting on the mat.
    [ID: 3] The dog lay lazily as the fox jumped over it.
    [ID: 4] Cats are known to sit on mats.
    [ID: 5] Canines are swift and can leap high.

    Output:
    {{
        "result": {{
            0: 0,
            1: 1,
            2: 0,

            5: 1
        }}
    }}
    </example>

    Follow these instructions carefully:

    1. Input: You will be provided with a list of sentences, each identified by a unique ID.

    2. Clustering Criteria:
        - Semantic Similarity: Group sentences that convey similar meanings, even if they use different words or structures.
        - Contextual Relevance: Sentences should be in the same cluster if they are relevant to the same topic or idea.
        - Paraphrasing: Sentences that are paraphrases of each other -- even if they contain different details -- should be clustered together.
        - When unsure, prefer assigning sentences to an existing cluster instead of creating a new one, to avoid over-segmentation.

    3. Output:
        - Output your response in a JSON format.
        - Return a dictionary where each key is a sentence ID (represented as an integer)
        - Each value is the cluster ID that the sentence belongs to.

    Please cluster the sentence IDs below according to the criteria mentioned above.

    <example>
    Existing Clusters:
    {{
        0: [0, 2, 4],
        1: [1, 3, 5]
    }}

    New Sentences:
    [ID: 6] Dogs sometimes jump over fences.
    [ID: 7] The mat is where the cat likes to sit.
    [ID: 8] Foxes are clever animals.

    Output:
    {{
        "result": {{
            6: 1,
            7: 0,
            8: 2
        }}
    }}

    Explanation:
    - Sentence 6 relates to Cluster 1 (about dogs and jumping).
    - Sentence 7 is similar to sentences in Cluster 0 (about cats and mats).
    - Sentence 8 doesn't fit into any existing cluster, so a new Cluster 2 is created.
    </example>

    Follow these instructions carefully:

    1. Input: You will now be provided with:
        - Existing Clusters: A dictionary where each key is a Cluster ID (an integer), and each value is a list of Sentence IDs that belong to that cluster.
        - New Sentences: A list of sentences, each identified by a unique Sentence ID.

    2. Clustering Criteria:
        - Use the same clustering instructions from before.
        - Preference for Existing Clusters: When unsure, prefer assigning sentences to an existing cluster instead of creating a new one, to avoid over-segmentation.

    3. Output:
        - Output your response in a JSON format.
        - Return a dictionary where each key is a Sentence ID (represented as an integer).
        - Each value is the Cluster ID that the sentence belongs to.
        - Use existing Cluster IDs when assigning sentences to existing clusters. If creating a new cluster, assign it a new unique Cluster ID (e.g., the next integer after the highest existing Cluster ID).

    Please assign the following new sentences to clusters according to the criteria mentioned above.

    Existing Clusters:
    {clusters_by_ids}

    New Sentences:
    {texts}

    Output:
