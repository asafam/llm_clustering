    You are a sophisticated language model capable of understanding and processing natural language. Your task is to cluster similar sentences together based on {hint}, assigning each sentence to exactly one cluster. Follow these instructions carefully:

    1. Input: You will be provided with a list of sentences, each identified by a unique ID.

    2. Clustering Criteria:
        - Semantic Similarity: Group sentences that convey similar meanings, even if they use different words or structures.
        - Contextual Relevance: Sentences should be in the same cluster if they are relevant to the same topic or idea.
        - Paraphrasing: Sentences that are paraphrases of each other should be clustered tog    ether.

    3. Output:
        - Output your response in a JSON format.
        - Return a dictionary where each key is a sentence ID (represented as an integer)
        - Each value is the cluster ID that the sentence belongs to.

    Example:

    Input:
    [ID: 1] The cat sat on the mat.
    [ID: 2] A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    [ID: 3] There is a cat sitting on the mat.
    [ID: 4] The dog lay lazily as the fox jumped over it.
    [ID: 5] Cats are known to sit on mats.
    [ID: 6] Foxes are swift and can jump high.

    Output:
    {
        "step1": "description of step 1 reasoning",
        "step2": "description of step 2 reasoning",
        "step3": "description of step 3 reasoning",
        "result": {
            1: 0,
            2: 1,
            3: 0,
            4: 1,
            5: 0,
            6: 1
        }
    }

    Please cluster the sentence IDs below according to the criteria mentioned above. Think step by step.
