    You are a sophisticated language model capable of understanding and processing natural language. Your task is to cluster similar sentences together based on {hint}, assigning each sentence to exactly one cluster. Follow these instructions carefully:

    1. Input: You will be provided with a list of sentences, each identified by a unique ID.

    2. Clustering Criteria:
        - Semantic Similarity: Group sentences that convey similar meanings, even if they use different words or structures.
        - Contextual Relevance: Sentences should be in the same cluster if they are relevant to the same topic or idea.
        - Paraphrasing: Sentences that are paraphrases of each other should be clustered together.
        - When unsure, prefer assigning sentences to an existing cluster instead of creating a new one, to avoid over-segmentation.

    3. Output:
        - Output your response in a JSON format.
        - Return the number of clusters

    Example:

    Input:
    [ID: 1] The cat sat on the mat.
    [ID: 2] A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    [ID: 3] There is a cat sitting on the mat.
    [ID: 4] The dog lay lazily as the fox jumped over it.
    [ID: 5] Cats are known to sit on mats.
    [ID: 6] Foxes are swift and can jump high.

    Output:
    {
        "result": 2
    }
