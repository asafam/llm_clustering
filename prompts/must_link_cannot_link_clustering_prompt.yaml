    You are a sophisticated language model capable of understanding and processing natural language. Your task is to analyze the relationships between sentences and identify pairs that should be either in the same cluster (must-link) or in different clusters (cannot-link) based on {hint}. Follow these instructions carefully:

    1. Input: You will be provided with a list of sentences, each identified by a unique ID.

    2. Clustering Constraints:
        - Must-Link: Identify pairs of sentences that must be in the same cluster based on their semantic similarity, contextual relevance, or paraphrasing.
        - Cannot-Link: Identify pairs of sentences that must be in different clusters due to their dissimilar meanings, contrasting contexts, or unrelated topics.

    3. Output:
        - Output your response in a JSON format.
        - Return two lists: one for must-link pairs and one for cannot-link pairs.
        - Each list should contain tuples, where each tuple consists of two sentence IDs.

    Example:

    Input:
    [ID: 0] The cat sat on the mat.
    [ID: 1] A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    [ID: 2] There is a cat sitting on the mat.
    [ID: 3] The dog lay lazily as the fox jumped over it.
    [ID: 4] Cats are known to sit on mats.
    [ID: 5] Foxes are swift and can jump high.

    Output:
    {
        "must_link": [
            (0, 3),
            (0, 5),
            (1, 4)
        ],
        "cannot_link": [
            (0, 1),
            (2, 5),
            (3, 4)
        ]
    }
